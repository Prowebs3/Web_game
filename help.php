        <h3>HELP</h3>
The game is all about testing your memory retention and decision power skills.
The game proceeds in different levels.  
The game runs in such a way that a question is displayed in the interface, and the player selects most suitable answer from the given options.
This game contains 3 levels, level 1, level 2 and level 3.
If the player click the correct image then go for the next level. 
And for each level ,the user gets a chance to play again if the input is wrong. 
In each level we provide a timer to complete the level.
